1. Introduction: Premise & what is the project about

Problem Identified:

The F&B industry has a high turnover rate and they are in need of a constant pool of manpower. At the same time, people (such as students or people in-between jobs) are looking for quick part time job opportunities. Often, searching for a job is not instantaneous and job applications come with lengthy application processes.

Jobs Lite aims to fix that by making it easy to search for a job and to apply instantly.

Solution:

Basic Features
Mobile First Designed Website.
Fast and easy way for both job-seeker and employer, specifically for young job-seekers to find part-time employment in the F&B industry.

Job seekers do not need to fill out long tedious forms repeatedly when they are looking for the same kind of part-time job.

Login to enable quick sign-up and login for job seekers.


Additional Features
Google maps that shows the location of the job and user’s current location.

Mailer function. Employers get notified via email with every job application. In addition, the email will be attached with a contract to legalise the employment period and the monetary   payout for the employees, making the recruitment process more efficient for job-seekers and employers.


2. Application Demo & Showcasing of the code

3. Monetisation Strategy

For every job match, we charge the employer a 5% service fee on top of remuneration sum that they need to pay the employee for the employment period.

Market Strategy:

Acquire McDonalds as our first client. Once a big player is in, the rest are more inclined to follow and list their jobs on our platforms.

Others potential choices: KFC & Pico’s Event Company.


4. Workflow
